Abstract: 

Spam email detection is crucial in modern communication, protecting users from threats like phishing, scams, and malware. This project aims to develop a spam email detection system using Python, employing machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham). 
We use a supervised learning approach with a labeled dataset of spam and ham emails. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Various classifiers, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests, are tested for effectiveness.
Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning and NLP to real-world problems, enhancing email security and user experience.
Python, with its libraries like scikit-learn, NLTK, and pandas, is used for efficient data manipulation, model building, and evaluation, making it an ideal platform for this spam detection system.


Modules used are:-
Streamlit ------- (Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science)
Pickle ----- (Pickle in Python is primarily used in serializing and deserializing a Python object structure. In other words, it's the process of converting a Python object into a byte stream to store it in a file/database, maintain program state across sessions, or transport data over the network.)
String ------(string module contains a single utility function - capwords(s, sep=None). This function split the specified string into words using str. split(). Then it capitalizes each word using str)
nltk-----( Natural Language Toolkit, is a Python package that you can use for NLP. A lot of the data that you could be analyzing is unstructured data and contains human-readable text. Before you can analyze that data programmatically, you first need to preprocess it.)
